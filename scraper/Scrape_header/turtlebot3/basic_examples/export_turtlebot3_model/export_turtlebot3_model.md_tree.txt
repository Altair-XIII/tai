TurtleBot3 has three models, `burger`, `waffle`, and `waffle_pi`, so you have to set which model to use before using.


##Ubuntu (h2)

To do this on Ubuntu, we specify the model to be used with the `export` command.

```
export TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL=burger
export TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL=waffle
export TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL=waffle_pi

```

The Bash `export` command is used to export a variable or function to the environment of all the child processes running in the current shell.

You can run this `export` command each time in the terminal window. But it is very inconvenient to set it up every time.

So we recommend that add your settings in `bashrc` file. The following example is an example for the user of TurtleBot3 Burger model. If you use a different model, you just change the value of `TURTLEBOT3_MODEL`.

```
$ gedit ~/.bashrc

```

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/bringup/bashrc.png)

```
$ source ~/.bashrc

```

TurtleBot3 has three models, `burger`, `waffle`, and `waffle_pi`, so you have to set which model to use before using.


##Windows (h2)

While TurtleBot3 has three models, only the `burger` and `waffle` are supported with a Windows 10 compatible single board computer.

On Windows, use the command `setx` to set the property globally, then restart the command window for the setting to take effect.

```
setx TURTLEBOT3_MODEL burger
setx TURTLEBOT3_MODEL waffle

```

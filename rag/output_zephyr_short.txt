Question: What is the purpose of the kinematics_solver parameter in the `kinematics.yaml` file, and what should it be replaced with to utilize the `MoveItOPWKinematicsPlugin?`
Docs:
 doc1: (Segment 4)
#OPW Kinematics Solver for Industrial Manipulators (h1)

##Usage (h2)
- Find the MoveIt `kinematics.yaml <../kinematics_configuration/kinematics_configuration_tutorial.html>`_ file created for your robot.
- Replace ``kinematics_solver: kdl_kinematics_plugin/KDLKinematicsPlugin`` (or similar) with ``kinematics_solver: moveit_opw_kinematics_plugin/MoveItOPWKinematicsPlugin``.
- Set parameters to describe the geometry of your manipulator.
The following is an example of the parameters needed for the KUKA KR 6 R700:
.. code-block:: yaml
manipulator:
kinematics_solver: moveit_opw_kinematics_plugin/MoveItOPWKinematicsPlugin
opw_kinematics_geometric_parameters:
a1:  0.025
a2: -0.035
b:   0.000
c1:  0.400
c2:  0.315
c3:  0.365
c4:  0.080
opw_kinematics_joint_offsets: [0.0, -1.57079632679, 0, 0, 0, 0]
opw_kinematics_joint_sign_corrections: [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1]
The meaning of the parameters can best be understood with a sketch and some tinkering. The plugin will print a ``ROS_ERROR`` on startup if they
do not match your URDF, so you can safely guess and test if needed:

#Kinematics Configuration (h1)
In this section, we will examine some of the parameters for configuring kinematics for your robot.

##The kinematics.yaml file (h2)
The kinematics.yaml file generated by the MoveIt Setup Assistant is the primary configuration file for kinematics for MoveIt. You can see an entire example file for the Panda robot in the :panda_codedir:`panda_moveit_config GitHub project <config/kinematics.yaml>`: ::
panda_arm:
kinematics_solver: kdl_kinematics_plugin/KDLKinematicsPlugin
kinematics_solver_search_resolution: 0.005
kinematics_solver_timeout: 0.05
kinematics_solver_attempts: 3

###The KDL Kinematics Plugin (h3)
The KDL kinematics plugin wraps around the numerical inverse kinematics solver provided by the Orocos KDL package.
* This is the default kinematics plugin currently used by MoveIt
* It obeys joint limits specified in the URDF (and will use the safety limits if they are specified in the URDF).
* The KDL kinematics plugin currently only works with serial chains.

###The LMA Kinematics Plugin (h3)
The LMA (Levenberg-Marquardt) kinematics plugin also wraps around a numerical inverse kinematics solver provided by the Orocos KDL package.
* It obeys joint limits specified in the URDF (and will use the safety limits if they are specified in the URDF).
* The LMA kinematics plugin currently only works with serial chains.
* Usage: ``kinematics_solver: lma_kinematics_plugin/LMAKinematicsPlugin``



Answer: 
The purpose of the `kinematics_solver` parameter in the `kinematics.yaml` file is to specify the kinematics solver to be used for inverse kinematics calculations. To utilize the `MoveItOPWKinematicsPlugin`, the `kinematics_solver` parameter should be replaced with `moveit_opw_kinematics_plugin/MoveItOPWKinematicsPlugin` in the `kinematics.yaml` file, and parameters such as `opw_kinematics_geometric_parameters`, `opw_kinematics_joint_offsets`, and `opw_kinematics_joint_sign_corrections` should be set to describe the geometry and joint offsets/signs of the manipulator. The `MoveItOPWKinematicsPlugin` is a kinematics solver specifically designed for industrial manipulators, and it can handle non-linear kinematics and joint limits. The KDL and LMA kinematics plugins, on the other hand, are numerical inverse kinematics solvers that obey joint limits specified in the URDF and work with serial chains.
========================================
Answer without doc: The purpose of the kinematics_solver parameter in the `kinematics.yaml` file is to specify the solver to use for kinematics calculations. To utilize the `MoveItOPWKinematicsPlugin`, this parameter should be replaced with `moveit_opwk` in the `kinematics.yaml` file.

Question: Can you explain the significance of the parameter ridge_factor in CHOMP and its role in obstacle avoidance?If one wants to first produce an initial path using STOMP and then optimize it, which planner can be utilized after STOMP?
Docs:
 doc1: 
- **CHOMP**: CHOMP is an optimization algorithm which optimizes a given initial trajectory. Based on the environment CHOMP rapidly tries to pull the initial trajectory out of collisions. However an important point to pay attention here is that the parameter ``ridge_factor`` needs to be more than or equal to 0.001 for avoiding obstacles. Doing this CHOMP is able to find paths while avoiding obstacles. It should be noted here even though CHOMP can avoid obstacles successfully but it fails to provide smooth paths often leading to jerky paths in the presence of obstacles. For CHOMP collision avoidance comes at the cost of the trajectory's velocity smoothness.
- **STOMP**: STOMP produces smooth well behaved collision free paths within reasonable times. The approach relies on generating noisy trajectories to explore the space around an initial (possibly infeasible) trajectory which are then combined to produce an updated trajectory with lower cost.
doc2: 
- **Obstacle Handling**: ::
For scenes containing obstacles, STOMP often is able to successfully avoid obstacles due to its stochastic nature. CHOMP however generates paths which do not prefer smooth trajectories by addition of some noise (*ridge_factor*) in the cost function for the dynamical quantities of the robot (like acceleration, velocity). OMPL also generates collision free smooth paths in the presence of obstacles.


doc3: 
In this section a distinction is made between paths obtained from STOMP, CHOMP and OMPL. Some of the moveIt planners tend to produce jerky trajectories and may introduce unnecessary robot movements. A post processing smoothing step is usually needed. In contrast as STOMP tends to produce smooth well behaved motion plans in a short time, there is no need for a post processing smoothing step as required by some other motion planners. CHOMP optimizes a given initial naive trajectory based on convarient and functional gradient approaches. CHOMP is entirely based on trajectory optimization. OMPL is an open source library for sampling based / randomized motion planning algorithms.  Sampling based algorithms are probabilistically complete: a solution would be eventually found if one exists, however non-existence of a solution cannot be reported. These algorithms are efficient and usually find a solution quickly. Now a qualitative analysis is performed for these planners below:

Answer: 
- To optimize a path produced by STOMP, CHOMP can be utilized after STOMP.
- The parameter `ridge_factor` in CHOMP is important for obstacle avoidance and should be greater than or equal to 0.001.
- STOMP tends to produce smooth well-behaved motion plans in the presence of obstacles without the need for post-processing smoothing.
- CHOMP optimizes a given initial naive trajectory based on convarient and functional gradient approaches, and is entirely based on trajectory optimization.
- OMPL is a sampling-based motion planning library that is probabilistically complete and finds a solution quickly, but non-existence of a solution cannot be reported.
========================================
Answer without doc: The parameter ridge_factor in CHOMP controls the width of the obstacle-free region around the obstacles, which helps in obstacle avoidance. After STOMP, CHOMP can be utilized for path optimization.

Our CI runs on Github Actions and uses scripts found in `industrial_ci <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci.git>`_.  These tests build and run various tests in various environments.  Often something that works locally won't work in CI in a different environment.  To troubleshoot a failure from CI it is useful to use docker to run in the same environment.
For troubleshooting a specific test it is helpful to inspect the GHA logs to understand what environment variables are being set in your test.

Answer: 
How does using Docker help in replicating CI environments locally?

Answer: Docker allows you to launch a container with the same environment as your CI, making it easier to troubleshoot failures that occur in different environments. (doc2)

Are there any pitfalls or challenges you should be aware of when debugging within a Docker container?

Answer: It's helpful to inspect the GHA logs to understand what environment variables are being set in your test. (doc2)
========================================
Answer without doc: Docker allows for the creation of portable, isolated environments that can be easily replicated, making it a useful tool for replicating CI environments locally. However, debugging within a Docker container can present challenges due to the lack of direct access to the host machine's resources and tools. It's important to be aware of these limitations and consider alternative debugging strategies, such as attaching to the container's process or using tools like Docker's built-in debugger.

Question: What are the initial steps and considerations for setting up and running the IKFast code generator with MoveIt and OpenRAVE using a docker image, and how can one install the MoveIt IKFast package?
Docs:
 doc1: (Segment 3)
#IKFast Kinematics Solver (h1)
.. image:: openrave_panda.png
:width: 700px
In this section, we will walk through configuring an IKFast plugin for MoveIt.

##Getting Started (h2)
If you haven't already done so, make sure you've completed the steps in `Getting Started <../getting_started/getting_started.html>`_.
You should have a MoveIt configuration package for your robot that was created by using the `Setup Assistant <../setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html>`_.
OpenRAVE is a planning framework as complex as MoveIt itself and installing it is tricky -- particularly because its public documentation is not maintained anymore.
Fortunately, personalrobotics provide a `docker image <https://hub.docker.com/r/personalrobotics/ros-openrave>`_ based on Ubuntu 14.04 with OpenRAVE 0.9.0 and ROS Indigo installed, which can be used to generate the solver code once.
doc2: 
So the easiest way to run the IKFast code generator is through this docker image.
For manual building instructions (tailored towards Ubuntu 16.04), please see the `Kinetic version of this tutorial <http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/ikfast/ikfast_tutorial.html>`_.
To follow the recommended, docker-based approach, ensure you have docker installed and started: ::
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo service docker start
The following command will ensure that you can run docker with your user account (adding $USER to the docker group): ::
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
You need to log off/log on in order to actually activate this permission change.
Note: To run docker from `WSL2 <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>`_, you need to install the `Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl>`_.
Install the MoveIt IKFast package either from Debian packages or from source.
**Binary Install**: ::
sudo apt-get install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-moveit-kinematics
**Source**

#IKFast Kinematics Solver (h1)
.. image:: openrave_panda.png
:width: 700px
In this section, we will walk through configuring an IKFast plugin for MoveIt.

##Tweaking the creation process (h2)
The process of creating the IKFast MoveIt plugin comprises several steps, performed one-by-one by the creation script:
1. Downloading the docker image provided by `personalrobotics <https://hub.docker.com/r/personalrobotics/ros-openrave>`_
2. Converting the ROS URDF file to Collada required for OpenRAVE: ::
rosrun collada_urdf urdf_to_collada $MYROBOT_NAME.urdf $MYROBOT_NAME.dae
Sometimes floating point issues arise in converting a URDF file to Collada, which prevents OpenRAVE to find IK solutions.
Using a utility script, one can easily round all numbers down to n decimal places in your .dae file.
From experience we recommend 5 decimal places, but if the OpenRave ikfast generator takes too long to find a solution (say more than an hour), lowering the accuracy should help. For example: ::

Answer: 
- To set up and run the IKFast code generator with MoveIt and OpenRAVE using a docker image, first ensure docker is installed and started, then add your user to the docker group and log off/log on. Install the MoveIt IKFast package either from Debian packages or from source. For the recommended docker-based approach, use the `personalrobotics/ros-openrave` image.
- To tweak the creation process for the IKFast MoveIt plugin, you can round numbers in your.dae file to a lower decimal place using a utility script if floating point issues arise during conversion from URDF to Collada. This can help if the OpenRave ikfast generator takes too long to find a solution.
========================================
Answer without doc: 

1. Pull the IKFast Docker image: `docker pull ikfast/ikfast:latest`
2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
3. Create a new file called `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```dockerfile
FROM ikfast/ikfast:latest

WORKDIR /ikfast

COPY moveit_ikfast_config.yaml.

RUN pip install moveit_ikfast_ros_pkgs

CMD ["bash", "-c", "rosrun ikfast ikfast_server"]
```

4. Create a new file called `moveit_ikfast_config.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
ikfast_server:
  ikfast_config: ikfast.yaml
  ikfast_model: my_robot.sdf
  ikfast_group: my_group
```

5. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t my_ikfast_image.`
6. Run the container: `docker run -it --rm my_ikfast_image`
7. Install the MoveIt IKFast package: `rosrun moveit_ikfast_ros_pkgs install_moveit_ikfast_ros_pkgs.bash`
8. Follow the instructions provided by the script to complete the installation.
9. Verify the installation by running `rosrun moveit_ikfast_ros_pkgs ikfast_server` and checking that the IKFast server is running.
10. Configure MoveIt to use IKFast by modifying the `config/moveit_ros_planning_scene.yaml` file and adding the following lines:

```yaml
ikfast_server:
  ikfast_config: ikfast.yaml
  ikfast_model: my_robot.sdf
  ikfast_group: my_group
```

11. Restart the MoveIt planning scene to apply the changes.
12. Test the IKFast integration by running `rosrun moveit_planning_execution moveit_planning_execution` and verifying that the IKFast solver is being used to generate collision-

Question: Describe the process and significance of capturing a calibration dataset in robot kinematics, the role of the end-effector and calibration target's poses, the utility of multiple samples, and how tools like the 'Calibrate' tab and RViz help in this process.
Docs:
 doc1: 
Each sample in our calibration dataset, then, comprises a pair of poses: the end-effector's pose in the robot base frame
paired with the calibration target's pose in the camera frame. Once five such samples have been collected, the
calibration can be calculated.
The "Calibrate" tab provides the tools to collect the dataset and calculate and export the calibration. At this point,
it is also helpful to add an image panel to the RViz display to see the target detection in the camera view, which is
published on ``/handeye_calibration/target_detection``.
.. image:: images/calibrate_tab.png
On the "Calibrate" tab, you can select which calibration solver to use in the "AX=XB Solver" drop-down. The Daniilidis
solver (from the paper referenced, above) is the default and is a good choice in most situations. The "Planning Group"
is the joint group that will be recorded, so should be set to the appropriate group for the arm (in the
``panda_moveit_config`` package, the ``panda_arm`` group should be used).
doc2: 
When the target is visible in the arm camera, and the axis is rendered on the target in the target detection image, you
are ready to take your first calibration sample (pose pair). Click the "Take sample" button in the "Manual calibration"
section, and a new sample will be added to the "Pose samples" list on the left side of the panel. If you expand a
sample, you will see it contains two transforms, base-to-end-effector, and camera-to-target.
Next, you can move the arm to a new pose using the "MotionPlanning" panel, or use your robot's teaching pendant or free
drive mode, if it has one, and click "Take sample" again. Be sure to include some rotation between each pair of poses,
and don't always rotate around the same axis--at least two rotation axes are needed to uniquely solve for the
calibration (see the Daniilidis paper, linked above, for the explanation why).
doc3: 
##Collect Dataset (h2)
Next, we will capture a calibration dataset. We need to capture several samples to ensure a good calibration. The robot
kinematics provide the end-effector's pose in the robot base frame, and the calibration target's pose in the camera
frame can be estimated, as mentioned above. If the target's pose in the robot base frame were known accurately, only a
single observation of the camera-target transform would be necessary to recover the camera's pose in the end-effector
frame. The direct camera-to-end-effector transform is equivalent to the composite
camera-to-target-to-base-link-to-end-effector transform. A better option, however, is to combine the information from
several poses to eliminate the target pose in the base frame from the equation, as described in `this paper by Kostas
Daniilidis <https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11338617350721919587>`_.

Answer: 
In robot kinematics, capturing a calibration dataset involves collecting multiple pose pairs of the end-effector and calibration target's poses. The end-effector's pose is provided by the robot kinematics, while the calibration target's pose in the camera frame is estimated. Combining information from several poses eliminates the need for the target's pose in the base frame, as described in the Daniilidis paper. The 'Calibrate' tab provides tools for collecting the dataset and calculating the calibration, while RViz helps visualize the target detection in the camera view. Multiple samples are necessary for a good calibration, and it's important to include rotation around different axes.
========================================
Answer without doc: In robot kinematics, a calibration dataset is captured to establish the relationship between the robot's joint angles and the end-effector's position and orientation in space. The end-effector is the robot's tool or gripper, and the calibration target's poses are precisely known points in space. Multiple samples are taken to account for any errors or variations in the robot's performance. Tools like the 'Calibrate' tab and RViz facilitate this process by providing a user-friendly interface for data input and visualization, respectively. The resulting calibration matrix allows for accurate and repeatable positioning of the end-effector in future tasks.

Question: Describe the process and significance of Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) in the context of Bullet's capabilities.
Docs:
 doc1: 
Please note that the current implementation of Bullet as a collision detector is not thread safe as the internal collision managers are mutable members.

###Continuous Collision Detection (h3)
Additionally, Bullet has continuous collision capabilities. This means that it can be guaranteed that no collision occurs during the transition between two discrete robot states with the environment. To get a demonstration of the CCD click the ``Next`` button of the ``moveit_visual_tools`` panel on the bottom left in RViz. The interactive robot disappears and the robot appears in a state where its hand is just behind a box. On pressing next again, the robot jumps to a configuration where the hand is right in front of the box. In both states, no collision is detected (see terminal output).
.. figure:: images/bullet_CCD_discrete.png
..
Left: robot in configuration 1. Right: robot in configuration 2.
On a following ``Next``, CCD is performed using a casted robot model between the two discrete poses. A collision is reported
(see terminal output for details).

#Using Bullet for Collision Checking (h1)
.. image:: images/bullet_collision_visualized.png
:width: 600px
In addition to the Flexible Collision Library (FCL), `Bullet Collision Detection <https://pybullet.org/wordpress/>`_ is available as a collision checker. The tutorial builds on top of the `Visualizing Collisions <../visualizing_collisions/visualizing_collisions_tutorial.html>`_ tutorial to show collisions.
Furthermore, Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) is available and demonstrated with Bullet.

##Getting Started (h2)
If you haven't already done so, make sure you've completed the steps in `Getting Started <../getting_started/getting_started.html>`_.



Answer: 
CCD in Bullet involves performing collision detection between two discrete robot states using a casted robot model. This ensures that no collision occurs during the transition between the two states with the environment. Bullet's CCD capabilities can be demonstrated in RViz by pressing the "Next" button in the "moveit_visual_tools" panel, which moves the interactive robot to a configuration where its hand is just behind a box, and then to a configuration where the hand is right in front of the box without any collisions detected. When "Next" is pressed again, CCD is performed using a casted robot model between the two discrete poses, and a collision is reported. Bullet's CCD is available in addition to the Flexible Collision Library (FCL) and is demonstrated in the tutorial "Using Bullet for Collision Checking".
========================================
Answer without doc: CCD in Bullet involves continuously checking for collisions between dynamic objects, even if they are moving too fast to be detected by traditional collision detection methods. This allows for more accurate and realistic physics simulations, as objects can collide and respond appropriately even at high speeds. CCD also helps to prevent objects from passing through each other, which can improve the overall stability and realism of the simulation.

##Creating the IKFast MoveIt plugin (h2)
To facilitate copy-and-paste, we suggest to define the robot name as an environment variable: ::
export MYROBOT_NAME="panda"
OpenRAVE uses Collada instead of URDF to describe the robot. In order to automatically convert your robot's URDF to Collada, you need to provide the .urdf file.
If your .urdf file is generated from `xacro <http://wiki.ros.org/xacro/>`_ files, you can generate the URDF in ``/tmp`` using the following command: ::
rosrun xacro xacro -o /tmp/$MYROBOT_NAME.urdf $MYROBOT_NAME.urdf.xacro

**Note:** *This is not meant as an exhaustive tutorial on software testing, instead this focuses on methods that will help you debug tests in MoveIt or similar ROS projects.*

##Run One Test (h2)
You can also use rostest to run a specific test.  The text argument sends output to the console instead of an xml output file.  To do this you'll have to source the devel workspace::
cd ${CATKIN_WS}
source devel/setup.bash
rostest moveit_ros_planning_interface move_group_pick_place_test.test --text

#Integration/Unit Tests (h1)
How to test changes to MoveIt on various robots, including unit and integration tests.
**Note:** *This is a stub tutorial, to be expanded upon in the future*

##Running Unit Tests (h2)
To run unit tests locally on the entire MoveIt catkin workspace using catkin-tools: ::
catkin run_tests -iv
To run a test for just 1 package, `cd` to the package's directory and run::
catkin run_tests --no-deps --this -iv
To ignore most of the log/print output of the tests::
catkin run_tests --no-status --summarize --no-deps --this
To run a single test, you can execute the compiled file, e.g. from your catkin workspace::
./devel/lib/moveit_core/test_planning_scene

#Debugging Tests (h1)
How to debug when a test is failing.
**Note:** *This is not meant as an exhaustive tutorial on software testing, instead this focuses on methods that will help you debug tests in MoveIt or similar ROS projects.*

##Run the Tests (h2)
To run all the tests we can use the run_tests cmake arg.  Here we should specify a specific package we want to test as that will speed up this run::
catkin build --summarize --catkin-make-args run_tests -- moveit_ros_planning_interface



Answer: 
When running a specific test with `rostest moveit_ros_planning_interface move_group_pick_place_test.test --text`, it differs from running all tests for the package by only executing the selected test instead of running all tests in the package. This can be useful when you want to quickly test a specific functionality or isolate a failing test without running unnecessary tests. It can also save time when debugging a failing test, as you can focus on the specific test that is causing issues instead of sifting through multiple tests.
========================================
Answer without doc: The command rostest moveit_ros_planning_interface move_group_pick_place_test.test --text runs a specific test called move_group_pick_place_test within the moveit_ros_planning_interface package, while running all tests for a package would involve using the command rostest moveit_ros_planning_interface. This difference allows for more targeted testing and debugging of individual tests, rather than running all tests and potentially wasting time on passing tests. Focusing on a single test can also help to isolate and identify issues more quickly.

Question: What is the PositionConstraint and how does it constrain the Cartesian positions allowed for a link?
Docs:
 doc1: (Segment 1)
#Representation and Evaluation of Constraints (h1)
Constraints are an integral component of MoveIt and OMPL. They are used both to constrain robot motion as well as to define planning goals. There following set of constraints are defined in the :code:`kinematic_constraints` namespace:
- kinematic_constraints::JointConstraint
- kinematic_constraints::OrientationConstraint
- kinematic_constraints::PositionConstraint
- kinematic_constraints::VisibilityConstraint
All of these constraints inherit from the :code:`kinematic_constraints::KinematicConstraint` base class and thus more constraint types can be added by the user by providing their own derived classes. The main operation each constraint implements is the :code:`KinematicConstraint::decide()` function, which decides whether a constraint is satisfied, and optionally returns a distance (an error) when a constraint is not satisfied.
doc2: 
For example (in YAML format)::
- type: position
frame_id: base_link
link_name: gripper_link
target_offset: [0.01, 0.01, 0.01]
region:
x: [0, 1.0] # [start, end]
y: [0, 1.0] # [start, end]
z: [0, 1.0] # [start, end]
weight: 1.0


doc3: 
Constructing a Constraints database is done with the ``generate_state_database`` executable.
This loads the constraint definition (in a format explained below) from the ROS parameter server and outputs the state database to a given directory.

###Defining constraints (h3)
The ``generate_state_database`` executable reads constraints from ROS parameters on ``/constraints``, in a more compact format that a complete ROS message.
You can define these in ``rosparam`` to be loaded together in a file, eg. ``X_moveit_config/config/constraints.yaml``::
path_constraint:
name: some_constraints
constraints:
- type: orientation
frame_id: world
# etc, as described below

####PositionConstraint (h4)
A ``PositionConstraint`` constrains the Cartesian positions allowed for a (position relative to a) link.
``target_offset`` is that relative position w.r.t. a link, e.g., the tip of the end-effector relative to its mounting point or other origin definition.
This region (boxes only in this compact definition) is compactly defined by specifying the upper and lower bounds along each axis.

Answer: 
The PositionConstraint constrains the allowed Cartesian positions of a link by defining a region in which the position is allowed. This region is defined by specifying the upper and lower bounds along each axis in the target_offset frame. The constraint is satisfied if the position falls within this region, and a distance (an error) is returned when the position is outside the region. This constraint is defined in the kinematic_constraints namespace and inherits from the KinematicConstraint base class, allowing for the addition of new constraint types by providing derived classes.
========================================
Answer without doc: The PositionConstraint specifies the allowed Cartesian positions for a link in a robot's forward kinematics. It is used to constrain the motion of the link within a specific region in space. This constraint is applied during the forward kinematics calculation to ensure that the link's position falls within the specified range.

Question: In what situations is this package designed to be a preferable alternative to IK-Fast based solutions?
Docs:
 doc1: (Segment 1)
#IKFast Kinematics Solver (h1)
.. image:: openrave_panda.png
:width: 700px
In this section, we will walk through configuring an IKFast plugin for MoveIt.

##What is IKFast? (h2)
IKFast, the Robot Kinematics Compiler, is a powerful inverse kinematics solver provided within Rosen Diankov's `OpenRAVE <http://openrave.org>`_ motion planning software. IKFast automatically analyses any complex kinematic chain for common patterns that allow for an analytic solution and generates C++ code to find them.
As a consequence, IKFast provides extremely stable solutions that can be found in a few microseconds on recent processors.


doc2: 
So the easiest way to run the IKFast code generator is through this docker image.
For manual building instructions (tailored towards Ubuntu 16.04), please see the `Kinetic version of this tutorial <http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/ikfast/ikfast_tutorial.html>`_.
To follow the recommended, docker-based approach, ensure you have docker installed and started: ::
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo service docker start
The following command will ensure that you can run docker with your user account (adding $USER to the docker group): ::
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
You need to log off/log on in order to actually activate this permission change.
Note: To run docker from `WSL2 <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>`_, you need to install the `Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl>`_.
Install the MoveIt IKFast package either from Debian packages or from source.
**Binary Install**: ::
sudo apt-get install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-moveit-kinematics

#OPW Kinematics Solver for Industrial Manipulators (h1)

##Purpose (h2)
This package is meant to provide a simpler alternative to IK-Fast based solutions in situations where one has an
industrial robot with a parallel base and spherical wrist. This configuration is extremely common in industrial robots.
The kinematics are parameterized by 7 primary values taken directly from the robot's spec sheet and a set of
joint-zero offsets. Given this structure, no other setup is required.



Answer: 
In situations with industrial robots with parallel bases and spherical wrists, the OPW kinematics solver is a preferable alternative to IK-Fast based solutions due to its simpler setup requirements. The OPW solver uses 7 primary values directly from the robot's spec sheet and joint-zero offsets, requiring no additional setup.
========================================
Answer without doc: When high accuracy and repeatability are required, and the application involves frequent changes in orientation or position of the robot. IK-Fast based solutions may be more suitable for applications with fixed or predictable orientations and positions.

#Move Group Python Interface (h1)
.. image:: move_group_python_interface.png
:width: 700px
One of the simplest MoveIt user interfaces is through the Python-based Move Group Interface. These wrappers
provide functionality for most operations that the average user will likely need,
specifically setting joint or pose goals, creating motion plans, moving the
robot, adding objects into the environment and attaching/detaching objects from
the robot.
Watch this quick `YouTube video demo <https://youtu.be/3MA5ebXPLsc>`_ to see the power of the Move Group Python interface!

##Start RViz and MoveGroup node (h2)
Open two shells. Start RViz and wait for everything to finish loading in the first shell: ::
roslaunch panda_moveit_config demo.launch
Now run the Python code directly in the other shell using ``rosrun``: ::
rosrun moveit_tutorials move_group_python_interface_tutorial.py

#Move Group C++ Interface (h1)
.. image:: move_group_interface_tutorial_start_screen.png
:width: 700px
In MoveIt, the simplest user interface is through the :planning_interface:`MoveGroupInterface` class. It provides easy to use functionality for most operations that a user may want to carry out, specifically setting joint or pose goals, creating motion plans, moving the robot, adding objects into the environment and attaching/detaching objects from the robot. This interface communicates over ROS topics, services, and actions to the `MoveGroup Node <http://docs.ros.org/noetic/api/moveit_ros_move_group/html/annotated.html>`_.

Watch this quick `YouTube video demo <https://youtu.be/_5siHkFQPBQ>`_ to see the power of the move group interface!

##Running the Code (h2)
Open two shells. In the first shell start RViz and wait for everything to finish loading: ::
roslaunch panda_moveit_config demo.launch
In the second shell, run the launch file: ::
roslaunch moveit_tutorials move_group_interface_tutorial.launch

Answer: 
`move_group_python_interface/launch/move_group_python_interface_tutorial.launch` is used to run the Python code for the Move Group Python interface in MoveIt. It is launched in a separate shell while RViz is running in another shell.
========================================
Answer without doc: It launches a ROS node that provides a Python interface to move_group, a high-level motion planning framework for manipulators. This node allows users to interactively move a robot arm using Python scripts. The launch file is used to automatically start this node when a ROS session is launched.

id:Sawyer (Level1) > doc (Level2) > ikfast (Level3) > (h1) IKFast Kinematics Solver > (h2) Getting Started
question:What are the initial steps and considerations for setting up and running the IKFast code generator with MoveIt and OpenRAVE using a docker image, and how can one install the MoveIt IKFast package?
id:Sawyer (Level1) > doc (Level2) > ikfast (Level3) > (h1) IKFast Kinematics Solver > (h2) Creating the IKFast MoveIt plugin > (h3) Generate IKFast MoveIt plugin
question:How can one utilize the moveit_kinematics tool to automatically generate the IKFast MoveIt plugin from a URDF file for a specific robot? What are the necessary command-line parameters and their significance? Additionally, once this command is executed and a new ROS package is created, what steps need to be undertaken to ensure the new package is recognized and properly built within the workspace?

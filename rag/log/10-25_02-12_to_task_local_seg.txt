id:Sawyer (Level1) > doc (Level2) > hand_eye_calibration (Level3) > (h1) Hand-Eye Calibration > (h2) Collect Dataset
question:Describe the process and significance of capturing a calibration dataset in robot kinematics, the role of the end-effector and calibration target's poses, the utility of multiple samples, and how tools like the 'Calibrate' tab and RViz help in this process.

question:How does using Docker help in replicating CI environments locally? Are there any pitfalls or challenges you should be aware of when debugging within a Docker container?
id:Sawyer (Level1) > doc (Level2) > test_debugging (Level3) > (h1) Debugging Tests > (h2) Run One Test
question:When you use the command to run a specific test, e.g., rostest moveit_ros_planning_interface move_group_pick_place_test.test --text, how does this differ from running all tests for a package, and why might you want to focus on a single test rather than all of them?
id:Sawyer (Level1) > doc (Level2) > opw_kinematics (Level3) > (h1) OPW Kinematics Solver for Industrial Manipulators > (h2) Usage
question:What automated feature does the MoveIt Setup Assistant offer in relation to the `kinematics.yaml` file, and how can you access it?
id:Sawyer (Level1) > doc (Level2) > opw_kinematics (Level3) > (h1) OPW Kinematics Solver for Industrial Manipulators > (h2) Usage
question:What is the purpose of the kinematics_solver parameter in the `kinematics.yaml` file, and what should it be replaced with to utilize the `MoveItOPWKinematicsPlugin?`
id:Sawyer (Level1) > doc (Level2) > opw_kinematics (Level3) > (h1) OPW Kinematics Solver for Industrial Manipulators > (h2) Purpose
question:In what situations is this package designed to be a preferable alternative to IK-Fast based solutions?

question:Describe the process and significance of Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) in the context of Bullet's capabilities.
id:Sawyer (Level1) > doc (Level2) > ikfast (Level3) > (h1) IKFast Kinematics Solver > (h2) Creating the IKFast MoveIt plugin > (h3) Generate IKFast MoveIt plugin
question:What is the primary goal of the "Generate IKFast MoveIt plugin" section?Where should the given command be issued to generate the IKFast MoveIt plugin?

question:What is the PositionConstraint and how does it constrain the Cartesian positions allowed for a link?
id:Sawyer (Level1) > doc (Level2) > planning_adapters (Level3) > (h1) Planning Adapter Tutorials > (h2) Planning Insights for different motion planners and planners with planning adapters
question:Can you explain the significance of the parameter ridge_factor in CHOMP and its role in obstacle avoidance?If one wants to first produce an initial path using STOMP and then optimize it, which planner can be utilized after STOMP?

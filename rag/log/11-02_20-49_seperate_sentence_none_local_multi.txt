id:Sawyer_md (Level1) > doc (Level2) > hand_eye_calibration (Level3) > (h1) Hand-Eye Calibration > (h2) Collect Dataset
question:Describe the process and significance of capturing a calibration dataset in robot kinematics, the role of the end-effector and calibration target's poses, the utility of multiple samples, and how tools like the 'Calibrate' tab and RViz help in this process.
id:Sawyer_md (Level1) > doc (Level2) > test_debugging (Level3) > (h1) Debugging Tests > (h2) Run One Test
question:When you use the command to run a specific test, e.g., rostest moveit_ros_planning_interface move_group_pick_place_test.test --text, how does this differ from running all tests for a package, and why might you want to focus on a single test rather than all of them?
id:Sawyer_md (Level1) > doc (Level2) > opw_kinematics (Level3) > (h1) OPW Kinematics Solver for Industrial Manipulators > (h2) Usage
question:What automated feature does the MoveIt Setup Assistant offer in relation to the `kinematics.yaml` file, and how can you access it?
id:Sawyer_md (Level1) > doc (Level2) > opw_kinematics (Level3) > (h1) OPW Kinematics Solver for Industrial Manipulators > (h2) Usage
question:What is the purpose of the kinematics_solver parameter in the `kinematics.yaml` file, and what should it be replaced with to utilize the `MoveItOPWKinematicsPlugin?`
id:Sawyer_md (Level1) > doc (Level2) > opw_kinematics (Level3) > (h1) OPW Kinematics Solver for Industrial Manipulators > (h2) Purpose
question:In what situations is this package designed to be a preferable alternative to IK-Fast based solutions?
id:Sawyer_md (Level1) > doc (Level2) > ikfast (Level3) > (h1) IKFast Kinematics Solver > (h2) Getting Started
question:What are the initial steps and considerations for setting up and running the IKFast code generator with MoveIt and OpenRAVE using a docker image, and how can one install the MoveIt IKFast package?

question:What is the PositionConstraint and how does it constrain the Cartesian positions allowed for a link?

question:How does using Docker help in replicating CI environments locally? Are there any pitfalls or challenges you should be aware of when debugging within a Docker container?
id:Sawyer (Level1) > doc (Level2) > test_debugging (Level3) > (h1) Debugging Tests > (h2) Run One Test
question:When you use the command to run a specific test, e.g., rostest moveit_ros_planning_interface move_group_pick_place_test.test --text, how does this differ from running all tests for a package, and why might you want to focus on a single test rather than all of them?

question:What automated feature does the MoveIt Setup Assistant offer in relation to the `kinematics.yaml` file, and how can you access it?
id:Sawyer (Level1) > doc (Level2) > opw_kinematics (Level3) > (h1) OPW Kinematics Solver for Industrial Manipulators > (h2) Usage
question:What is the purpose of the kinematics_solver parameter in the `kinematics.yaml` file, and what should it be replaced with to utilize the `MoveItOPWKinematicsPlugin?`
